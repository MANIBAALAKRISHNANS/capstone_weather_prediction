## THE PROBLEM YOU HAD

```
ERROR: ValueError: X has 8 features, but RandomForestRegressor is expecting 20 features

CAUSE:
- Your app.py created only 8 features for prediction
- The model was trained with 26 features
- Machine Learning requires exact feature matching
- Mismatch → Crash!

EXAMPLE:
Training created: [f1, f2, f3, ..., f26] = 26 features
Your app sent: [f1, f2, f3, ..., f8] = 8 features
                                    ↑ Only 8!
Model said: "Error! I expect 26, not 8!"
```
